## Getting Started

- Clone this repository:
  - ```git clone https://github.com/wxsd-sales/wxcalling-click-to-call-demo```

- [Click to Call must be configured in Control Hub](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/ndzk21eb/Enable-customers-to-reach-your-organization-using-browser-based-click-to-call?_gl=1*1d1snt7*_gcl_au*NDI2OTEwODc1LjE3NDI4MzQ4ODAuMzYyNjU5MDUwLjE3NDM3MDQ3ODIuMTc0MzcwNDc4MQ..#configure_click-to-call)
  - You do not need to create a widget (that's what this repo is for).

## Installation

### 1. Setting up a Webex Service App

* a. [Create a new Webex Service App](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new)
  * You can give it any name ("Guest Calling Service App" - Will only appear in Control Hub).
* b. The Scopes selected must be:
  * ```spark:calls_read```
  * ```spark:calls_write```
  * ```spark:people_read```
  * ```spark:devices_read```
  * ```spark:telephony_config_read```
  * ```spark:webrtc_calling```
  * ```guest-issuer:read```
  * ```guest-issuer:write```
* c. Save the client_id, and client_secret for later
* d. [Service App Authentication Instructions](https://developer.webex.com/docs/service-apps) - you will need an Org Admin to Approve this Service App in order to generate a Refresh Token, which you will need later.
  * If you are an org admin, you can approve your own Service App in CH.


### 2. Setting up the .env file
- a. Inside this project's root folder, rename the file ```.env.example``` to ```.env```
- b. In a text editor, open the ```.env```
- c. Choose a ```PORT``` or use ```PORT=5000``` if you are not sure what to use.
- d. Choose a ```QUEUE_NUMBER``` which should be a Webex Calling Queue Extension that has been configured for Click to Call in Control Hub.
- e. Paste the client_id and client_secret values from step 1 to the right of the ```=``` for the corresponding ```CLIENT_ID=``` and ```CLIENT_SECRET=``` variables.
- f. Paste the refresh_token that you generated in Step 1 after an admin has approved it (see authentication instructions in step 1) as the ```REFRESH_TOKEN``` variable value.

### 3.a. Running the widget webserver as a container (Docker) (recommended)

- If you prefer to run this through ```npm```, skip this step and proceed to 3.b.
- Otherwise, run the following commands from the terminal inside your project's root directory:
- `docker build -t guest-calling-demo .`
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 -i -t guest-calling-demo`
  - replace `5000` in both places with the ```PORT``` used in your `.env` file.  

### 3.b. Running the widget webserver (npm)
_Node.js version 21.5 was used to develop this application._

- It is recommended that you run this as a container (step 3.a.).
- If you do not wish to run the webserver as a container (Docker), proceed with this step:
- Inside this project on your terminal type: `npm install`
- Then inside this project on your terminal type: `npm start`
- This should run the app on your ```PORT``` (from .env file)
